Efficient sensor scheduling is a critical challenge in multi-functional passive surveillance systems, where hardware resources must be optimally allocated to balance multiple objectives, such as electromagnetic spectrum survey and target tracking. This paper frames the sensor scheduling problem within the Optimal Experimental Design (OED) paradigm, leveraging information-theoretic and Bayesian optimization principles. We formulate the scheduling task as a multi-objective optimization problem, where one objective aims to maximize information gain in target tracking using RÃ©nyi divergence, while the other seeks to ensure an unbiased survey of the frequency spectrum through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization. To effectively handle the trade-offs between these conflicting goals, we apply goal programming scalarization, offering a more robust alternative to traditional epsilon-constraint methods. A simulation-based case study demonstrates how the proposed optimization framework dynamically adjusts sensor tuning strategies, achieving a balanced allocation of system resources. The results highlight the potential of experimental design methodologies for improving real-time sensor tasking in complex, uncertain environments. This work bridges the gap between decision-theoretic experimental desig and practical sensor scheduling applications, providing insights applicable to adaptive sensing, electronic warfare, and autonomous surveillance systems.
