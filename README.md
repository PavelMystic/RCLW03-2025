# About the keynote

This presentation focuses on the problem of multi-static passive sensor scheduling. VERA-NG is a super-heterodyne sensor whose key point is to traverse through the frequency spectrum so that all the user requirements are fulfilled. The three most important requirements are surveillance, target tracking, and electronic support measures. First, the VERA-NG sensor is introduced and the historical overview of its development is presented. Then we proceed to show how the problem of sensor scheduling is different from the usual radar resource management (RRM) problem. We translate requirements (or tasks) into the information-theoretic domain. Having them in this common domain, we then follow with the formulation of the sensor scheduling as the multi-criteria optimization problem which produces the optimal tuning plan for a chosen time horizon. Using simulated data, we illustrate some advantageous properties of such a tuning plan and present plans for future development. Our approach has shown to be scalable in terms of the number of sensors and can be translated into many different domains where such a super-heterodyne sensor is used.
